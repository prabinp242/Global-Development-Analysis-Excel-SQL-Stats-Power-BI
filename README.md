#  Global Development Analysis (1960â€“2016)

This project explores how global indicators like GDP, Literacy Rate, and Health metrics have changed over time across countries and regions. The analysis integrates Excel for data cleaning, SQL for transformations, Descriptive Statistics for insights, and Power BI for visual storytelling.

##  Objective

The objective of this project is to analyze and derive insights from global data covering population, GDP, country characteristics, and health-related indicators from multiple sources. The data comes from four different files, and you will use Power BI to connect these data sources (Excel and SQL), clean, transform, perform basic descriptive statistical analysis, and visualize insights. The final deliverable will be a comprehensive dashboard that highlights key insights derived from the data.
